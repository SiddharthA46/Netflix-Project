Netflix Dataset Analysis Project

Overview
This project involves analyzing a Netflix dataset to uncover patterns and insights about its content library and viewership trends. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and transform the data, identify key metrics, and generate actionable insights. The project demonstrates proficiency in working with large datasets and creating visualizations to tell a data-driven story.

Technologies Used
Data Analysis:
Python: Core programming language for analysis.
Pandas: Data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
NumPy: Numerical computations and array handling.
Data Visualization:
Seaborn: For visually appealing and statistical plots.
Matplotlib: For creating customized visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: For organized and reproducible workflows.

Steps in the Project
1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values:
Imputed missing values in columns like Country, Rating, and Director.
Dropped rows with significant missing data in non-critical columns.
Standardized Formats:
Converted date columns to datetime format for consistency.
Standardized text formats for fields like Country and Genres.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
General Insights:
Analyzed the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows).
Identified the most common genres and countries producing content.
Trend Analysis:
Visualized the number of releases over time to identify trends in Netflixâ€™s content strategy.
Examined popular ratings and their distribution across regions.
